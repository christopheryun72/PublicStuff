Group Project Topic: Opiate Deaths
Group Names: Christopher Yun, Amanda Yang, Ruby Frey

- SAMSHA = Contains EDA done on the SAMHSA dataset
- PDAPS = Contains EDA done on the PDAPS dataset
- KFF = Contains EDA done on the KFF dataset

We are utilizing three different datasets, one of which contains
our target variable "Deaths_per_100k" in the overdose_data.csv from KFF.

The other two datasets from SAMHSA and PDAPS, which are denoted as such,
provide explanatory/predictor features/data that will soon be aggregated/
merged into one dataset for modeling.
